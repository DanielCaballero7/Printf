# Printf

**ft_printf: A Custom Printf Function**

## Overview

"ft_printf" is an impressive project that demonstrates my expertise in string formatting and handling variable argument lists in C. This custom implementation of the `printf` function showcases my mastery of low-level string manipulation and parsing.

## Description

"ft_printf" is a custom version of the standard `printf` function found in the C standard library. It supports a wide range of format specifiers, allowing users to print formatted output to the console or a file.

The project involves parsing the format string to identify placeholders for variable arguments, such as integers, strings, characters, and pointers. The implementation manages the conversion and formatting of these arguments and efficiently prints them to the specified output.

"ft_printf" replicates the behavior of the original `printf` function while providing additional format specifiers and modifiers to enhance functionality. The project also ensures compatibility with the C standard library functions and adheres to the printf format specification.

## Key Features

- **Variable Argument Handling**: "ft_printf" efficiently manages variable argument lists, displaying different data types based on format specifiers.

- **Format Specifiers and Modifiers**: The project supports a wide range of format specifiers and modifiers, making it versatile for various output formatting needs.

- **String Manipulation**: "ft_printf" demonstrates my expertise in string manipulation, ensuring proper handling of the format string and variable arguments.

- **Robust Error Handling**: The implementation includes thorough error handling to manage unexpected input and maintain stable performance.

## Outcome

Developing "ft_printf" has allowed me to delve deep into the intricacies of string formatting and variable argument handling in C. The project showcases my ability to replicate and extend the functionality of core C library functions.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Usage

To use "ft_printf" in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the "ft_printf.h" header file in your C program.
3. Compile your C program along with the "ft_printf.c" source file.

## Note

"ft_printf" is a personal project developed for educational and demonstrative purposes. It is not intended for commercial use but can be freely utilized to enhance the formatting capabilities of C programs.
